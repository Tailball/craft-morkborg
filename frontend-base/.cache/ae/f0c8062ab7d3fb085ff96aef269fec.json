A spiked flail to the face. Light on rules, heavy everything else. </h2> <p> <strong>MÖRK BORG is a pitch-black apocalyptic fantasy RPG about lost souls and fools seeking redemption, forgiveness or the last remaining riches in a bleak and dying world.</strong> Who are you? The tomb-robber with silver glittering between cracked fingernails? The mystic who would bend the world’s heart away from it’s inevitable end? Confront power-draining necromancers, skulking skeletal warriors and backstabbing wickheads. Wander the Valley of the Unfortunate Undead, the catacombs beneath the Bergen Chrypt or the bedevilled Sarkash forest. But leave hope behind – the world’s cruel fate is sealed, and all your vain heroic efforts are destined to end in death and dismay. Or are they? </p> </section> <section class=\"shop-section\" id=\"section-shop--items\"> <h1>MÖRK BORG CONTENT</h1> <div class=\"section-shop--items--container\"> <div class=\"section-shop-items--container--item\"> <div class=\"section-shop-items--container--item--description\"> <h2>The Goblin Grinder</h2> <p>The streets of Galgenbeck are overrun by Goblins, turning burgher and pauper alike into their own cursed kin.
